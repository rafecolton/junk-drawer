## What It Is

This is *theoretically* a basic chat client, functioning as a proof of concept with
RabbitMQ.

## What It *Really* Is

In reality, this is just me fooling around with a few technologies, including:

* [node](http://nodejs.org/)
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [less](http://lesscss.org/)
* [Dust (the LinkedIn fork)](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs)
* [SockJS-client](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client)
* [Coffee-Toaster](https://github.com/serpentem/coffee-toaster) (which has sadly been discontinued)

## One More Note...

For what it's worth, I don't have any plans to continue working on this repo.
However, I am keeping it around because it was a fun experiment and it contains some reasonable
(albeit incomplete) code examples.

**Enjoy!**
