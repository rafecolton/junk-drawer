CS 1630,marai@cs.pitt.edu,5129 Sennott Square,"Software-System Design and Management is a software engineering course with particular emphasis on project management, usability testing, customer interviewing, specification of formal requirements, and oral communication. In addition to the focus on a team programming project, we discuss, debate, and think about the team software design and development process. The students learn how to effectively communicate orally - from pitching ideas to a project manager, to interviewing a customer, resolving conflict with another team member, giving feedback and presenting results."
