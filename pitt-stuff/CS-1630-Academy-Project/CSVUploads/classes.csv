CS 1555,panos@cs.pitt.edu,5129 Sennott Square,"The objective of this course is to provide an in-depth knowledge of database systems design. Thus, the emphasis is on how to model ones own data and how to use available Database Management Systems effectively. Towards this end, the relational and the object-relational models are discussed in great detail and object-oriented and other data models are also presented. Commercial database management systems are examined and students get practical experience through the use of such systems."
CS 1501,ramirez@cs.pitt.edu,5129 Sennott Square,"This course covers a broad range of the most commonly used algorithms. Some examples include algorithms for sorting, searching, encryption, compression and local search. The students will implement and test several algorithms. The course is programming intensive."
