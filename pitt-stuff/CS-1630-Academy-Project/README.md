CS 1630 Academy Project
=======================

## Quick Overview

This repo contains the results of a semester-long project for "CS 1630", 
which is one of the "Software Engineering" courses offered at Pitt.

In 30 seconds or less: this project is intended to be a standalone
website for submitting and auto-grading Java & Python homework
assignments.  It also contains a command-line tool for actually doing the
grading.  The primary languages used are PHP and JavaScript.

Though no work is *currently* being done on this project, a huge amount
went into it previously, so this repo will stick around for a while.
