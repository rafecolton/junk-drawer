CS 1950 Independent Study
=========================

## Overview

This project was a semester-long independent study with the stated goal
of eventually serving as an advising website for the Pitt CS department.

It never got to a point of being usable and the design is pretty ill
thought out.  Ultimately, it afforded me an opportunity to play around
with (and learn) [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Fat-Free Framework](https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree).
